# Finding Illegal Wild Life Trade on Twitter

## Abstract
The illegal trade of wildlife (IWT) is a major concern in the world today. It is estimated that over XX billion animals are killed each year by illegal trade. Of that, XX are poached for their ivory.  Some of these poached species include the African Elephant, Walrus, and X. To help stop IWT, we are investigating the use of Twitter to identify illegal wildlife trade and potentially remove the offending tweets. We worked under the assumption that if poachers have no clients, they have no incentive to participate in IWT. In this paper we are making two contributions a BERT based machine learning model for identifying IWT and the largest dataset of IWT tweets. We will also discuss the potential impact of this project on the world of wildlife trade.

## Introduction 
What should be in the introduction
We are looking at whether followers of known IWT sellers have a greater chance of being IWT sellers
We are creating a large dataset of IWT tweets
There are small dataset, but nothing that is large
We are going to use true machine learning to classify IWT tweets
There has been machine learning that has been used before, but it was using a biterm topic model. I would like to use BERT to classify the tweets

Our goal was to demonstrate that it was possible to make a machine learning model that is able to distinguish the trade of ivory vs normal Tweets. This gave us two challenges. The first being there were no existing large datasets about ivory trade on Twitter. There was X dataset, but it only contained 10 tweets. We were able to create a dataset with X Tweets. Using that dataset, we were able to create a machine learning model that was able to reasonably accurately distinguish between ivory trade and non-ivory trade.
