"1","here is the ivory panel and the information provided in the gallery {{url}} [sep] antique dealers: a research project on the history of the antiques trade in britain, a cultural geography - an ahrc research project. [sep]  the tragic provenance of 2 mediaeval ivory

max silberberg, 1878-1945

the ivory showing a man and a woman playing chess (2013.1.3; no. 19 in the first
case on your right as you enter the wellby room) came to the ashmolean museum
with the bequest of michael wellby, who died in 2012.

neither the museum at that time nor mr wellby knew that the ivory had formed part
of the collection of the german jewish businessman max silberberg, of breslau (now:
wroclaw, poland), who had acquired it following its sale from the collection of emile
lévy in 1928. it was sold from the silberberg collection at graupe’s auction house,
berlin, on 12 october 1935, lot 228. mr silberberg and his wife were victims of nazi
persecution and eventually murdered at auschwitz.

as soon &s the museum became aware of the provenance to this anonymous 1935
sale, it contacted the commission for looted art to report the possibly questionable
provenance. this subsequently led to a claim for restitution being submitted on behalf
of the heirs of max silberberg.

the claim was referred to the spoliation advisory panel, set up by the british
government. on 10 february 2016 the panel published its judgement that the ivory is
legally owned by the ashmolean and that the sale in 1935 was a result of mr
silberberg’s personal financial situation rather than nazi oppression; the panel

“the moral claim is insufficiently strong to warrant a recommendation of

restitution”: the report is available on line at {{url}}.

n fully recognizes and deplores the evil committed against j:w§ and
izi government between 1933 and 1945. it collaborates }_u'oac!}vely
imant families and their representatives and seeks to give fair and
ion to any claims made by heirs, including cases where the

le under english law. all claims are referred to the spoliation
e museum abides by the recommendations made by the panel.
